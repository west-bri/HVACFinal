This is a customer building with multiple roof top units but only 2 of them are connected to terminal units.  

I included data for the 2 that are connected to terminal units and one that is not.  

There are 47 terminal units in the building.  Each of them is connected to one of the two RTUs (not evenly split).

I feel like this should give a fair amount of data to build off of and then test. 

At first I will not give insights into which units are connected but will as we go along to help validate findings.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
