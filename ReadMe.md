##  Work in progress

- /DataExploration_BW.py - Initial exploration of the data to determine viability of clustering, correlation, etc.
- /data/terminalDescription.txt examines measures of central tendancy of the features we'll be studying
- #### Data files created so far
- /data/terminalDistinctValues.csv
- /data/terminalUnitsCleaned.csv
- /data/terminalUnitsRawData.csv

## Data Directory - Folders containing client data

- /data/terminalUnits
- /data/correlation
- /data/roofTopUnits
- /data/terminalUnits

## Important notes about the datasets from the client

- This is a customer building with multiple roof top units but only 2 of them are connected to terminal units. I included data for the 2 that are connected to terminal units and one that is not.  
- There are 47 terminal units in the building. Each of them is connected to one of the two RTUs (not evenly split). I feel like this should give a fair amount of data to build off of and then test. 
- At first I will not give insights into which units are connected but will as we go along to help validate findings.

- I do see a lot of missing setpoints. I think for your analysis on setpoints you can forward fill them as they are fairly static (we canâ€™t ffill sensors)
- The other thing to note is EffSp is the effective setpoint.  This is basically telling you the current setpoint regardless of occupancy or mode.  So, it the machine has it this is the most important but not every machine has it.
